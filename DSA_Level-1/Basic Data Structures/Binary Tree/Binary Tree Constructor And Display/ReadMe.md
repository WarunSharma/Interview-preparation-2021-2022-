Problem Discussion :
Here you will be provided with the preorder of the binary tree in an array form. All you need to do is to construct a binary tree using this information.

Sounds easy!

Problem Discussion :
Suppose that a user constructed the binary tree using the Construction function and now he wants to see whether the right value has been allocated to the right node or not.

So while accessing the root node of this binary tree, all you need to do is to display the binary tree by making a function display(). Look at the figure below to understand the format of output, user needs.
