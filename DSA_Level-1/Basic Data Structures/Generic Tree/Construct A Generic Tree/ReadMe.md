Problem Discussion :
We will be given an array of integers and we have to construct a tree using the values in that array. How are we going to do it? For that, first we need to understand how the array is filled and what each value inside the array means.

Approach :
Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the generic tree

Space Complexity: O(n)
