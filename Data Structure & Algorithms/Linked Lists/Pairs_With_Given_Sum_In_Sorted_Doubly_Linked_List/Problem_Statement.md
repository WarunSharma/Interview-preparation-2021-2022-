Find pairs with given sum in doubly linked list
Difficulty Level : Easy
Last Updated : 11 May, 2021
Given a sorted doubly linked list of positive distinct elements, the task is to find pairs in a doubly-linked list whose sum is equal to given value x, without using any extra space? 

Example:  

Input : head : 1 <-> 2 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 8 <-> 9
        x = 7
Output: (6, 1), (5,2)
The expected time complexity is O(n) and auxiliary space is O(1).
