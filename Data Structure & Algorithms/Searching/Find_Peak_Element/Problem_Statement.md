Find a peak element
Difficulty Level : Medium
Last Updated : 02 Jun, 2021
Given an array of integers. Find a peak element in it. An array element is a peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour. 

Example:

Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
Output: 20
The element 20 has neighbours 10 and 15,
both of them are less than 20.

Input: array[] = {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}
Output: 20 or 90
The element 20 has neighbours 10 and 15, 
both of them are less than 20, similarly 90 has neighbours 23 and 67.
