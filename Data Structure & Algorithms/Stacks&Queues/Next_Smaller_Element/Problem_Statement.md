Difficulty Level : Medium
Last Updated : 31 Aug, 2021
Given an array, print the Next Smaller Element (NSE) for every element. The Smaller smaller Element for an element x is the first smaller element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no smaller element exist (on right side), consider next smaller element as -1. 
Examples: 
a) For any array, rightmost element always has next smaller element as -1. 
b) For an array which is sorted in increasing order, all elements have next smaller element as -1. 
c) For the input array [4, 8, 5, 2, 25}, the next smaller elements for each element are as follows.

Element       NSE
   4      -->   2
   8      -->   5
   5      -->   2
   2      -->   -1
   25     -->   -1
d) For the input array [13, 7, 6, 12}, the next smaller elements for each element are as follows.  

  Element        NSE
   13      -->    7
   7       -->    6
   6       -->    -1
   12     -->     -1
