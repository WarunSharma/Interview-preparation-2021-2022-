Java Program to Check if a string is a valid shuffle of two distinct strings
In this example, we will check if a string is the valid shuffle of two other strings in Java.

In the above example, we have a string array named results. It contains three strings: 1XY2, Y1X2, and Y21XX. We are checking if these three strings are valid shuffle of strings first(XY) and second(12).
